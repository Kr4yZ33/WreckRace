WRECKRACE THE PRACTICE SESSION | FENIS VS NEPTIS

Fire Elemental - Fernis | Water Elemental - Neptis | You - Neptis Assault Unit

You look down at your hands, their appearance altered for this practice session, only twin ice spheres remaining. Thanks to the near depthless limits of the Ancient Water Elemental Neptis' Elemental Essence, the practice track stretches before your invisible face.

You look around, in the background "Another Planet" loomed mighty and foreboding in the background, fire cracked and representing the awesome power of Fernis the Ancient Fire Elemental.

Twin tracks run parallel to each other above you, your light vehicle and an array of both red and blue practice weapons are arrayed before you.

Light, Medium and Heavy. This session was limited to only ranged weapons, with the exception of vehicle wheels and body, which act like melee weapons.

The main aim of this practice session was to enter the practice vehicle, which happens as soon as you stand next to it. Then forward and follow the guide rings. Once on the upper track, your driving skills would really shine, picking up the boombox in your right hand you pull the trigger and start the background music playing. 


Replacing the boombox with a blue weapon, you use you left hand to portal around with the grab button. Getting close to the car and keeping hold of the weapon in your right hand.

Once in the vehicle, using your left hand the trigger accelerates, your 4WD WreckRacer takes off and the X & Y buttons let you turn left or rights through the checkpoint rings. Moving the analogue stick in any direction breaks. The car guns can be fired by passing your right hand through the sphere in the front right of the car cockpit.

The aim of the game is to get the best time + your score from hitting red targets along the way. It's about the trade off between high speed and hitting lots of targets! 

#####################

Controls are: to get in car just get rig close to it, there is a teleport platform above the drivers cockpit, you can use this to exit or get to the roof to shoot. Once in car, left controller moves and steers car using the Y & X buttons. Trigger is accelerate, any direction on analog stick breaks. Pass right hand through the spere on the right of the car dash to shoot the car guns (they shoot on hover enter and exit). At the bottom of the tracks opposite end to the jump, there is a trigger area that will teleport the blue car up onto the track. Grab portals around including up onto the tracks. The blue Jump has a power booster on it that activates when the Blue Car hits the jump area. 

Backstory

In Eons past, in the farthest reaches of the Universe, five Ancient Elementals (AEs) were spawned during the cataclysmic event of two stars colliding. Each representing the element that gave them life, Fire, Earth, Air, Water and Void.

For a long time the AEs were content with building the planets they had occupied. Each molding the planet over time to represent their element, each and every planet a wonder of the Universe, a unique sight to behold.

After millennia the AEs grew bored, they conceived a grand game, from which a new race of beings emerged. These beings were to fight like gladiators in a massive battle royal, staged over many matches, to find a Champion team among one of the new races. 

Each match is staged on another planet, a home side vs an away one. A mixture of driving, ranged and hand to hand combat. Teams work to race around a track and clear targets faster than their opponents. Don't stay in one spot for too long... Otherwise the gun turrets are sure to splatter your skin cubes all over the pavement!

5 factions | Air | Fire | Earth | Water | Void

5 classes of troops and 5 players per side each match, each faction has a class of tropp that is stronger for them. E.g. Fire & Assualt.
Ninja - Void | Assualt - Fire | Engineer - Earth | Monk - Water | Sniper - Air
